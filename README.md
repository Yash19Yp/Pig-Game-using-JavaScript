# Pig Game

## Overview

Pig Game is a simple dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a two-player game where each player takes turns rolling a dice. The goal is to reach a certain score (default: 100) to win the game. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in that turn, and it's the next player's turn. Players can also choose to hold their current score, adding it to their total score and passing the turn to the next player.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Enter the target score for winning the game (if you want to customize it).
2. **Roll the Dice**: Click on the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice. The number rolled will be added to the player's current score unless a 1 is rolled.
3. **Hold**: Click on the "Hold" button to add the current score to the total score. It will be the next player's turn.
4. **Winning**: The first player to reach the target score wins the game.
